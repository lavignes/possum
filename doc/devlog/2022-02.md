Technically, I started this project a few days ago. Or really, I started this
months ago as I got really enthusiastic about writing software for 68000 CPUs.
I initially started writing an TLSv1.2 implementation for classic MacOS so
I'd be able to access modern servers without any additional hardware
(i.e. proxying TLS on a raspberry pi).

I really wanted a simple CPU, though. Ideally RISC, but without a lot of modern
features. At first, I started designing my own, but as I worked on the ISA it
became apparent that I was giving myself *way too much* leeway on the types
of features the CPU had. In particular, a giant 32-bit address space and easy
to program virtual memory made this project a bit more boring. So I scrapped it.

*Enter Possum Computer...*

Anyone who knows me for more than a few days will invariably learn about my love
for the Game Boy. In particular, I love how clever the design of the hardware is.
It was essentially late-70s early-80s microcomputer tech re-purposed into a
fully-featured handheld computer. Learning to program for it when I was a teen
exposed me to low-level concepts like interrupts, timers, and even DMA.

The limitations of the Game Boy are what make it so fun. So why not make a
computer that gets around the 8-bit limitations the same way the Game Boy
did? How far can we get with it?

[//]: # (title: Compact Flash Emulation)

Not much to report, but today the compact flash emulation is probably
as close to code-complete as I think it will get. It took me about 2 days,
and I haven't tested it of course.

I think the biggest roadblock for me while implementing it was the fact that I
made this slick interface:

```rust
struct CFCard<F> {
    file: F,
    // ...
}

impl<F: Read + Write + Seek> for CFCard<F> {
    // ...
}
```

The `CFCard` struct would maintain an internal 512 byte buffer (the size of a
sector) and read/flush it at the start/end of file operations.

Turns out, I didn't consider the fact that C-style file IO (which is what Rust
uses as well) doesn't have a way to replace a single 512 byte block in the
middle of a file. Fortunately, my mind immediately jumped to memory-mapping.
And luckily there is a nice crate for doing memory-mapped file IO in Rust:
`memmap2`. Switching over really only took a few minutes.

```rust
pub trait MemoryMap: IndexMut<usize, Output = u8> {
    type Error: error::Error;

    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;

    fn len(&self) -> usize;
}

struct CFCard<M> {
    mmap: M,
    // ...
}

impl<M: MemoryMap> for CFCard<F> {
    // ...
}
```

*Fingers crossed that the unit tests just work...*
